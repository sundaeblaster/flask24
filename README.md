# Docker

## What is Docker?
Docker is a platform that easily allows for a user to ship and run containers. Using docker is more advantageous than using a virtual machine beacuse it requires less resources 
and makes it easier to share applications. Comparing it to real life, Docker is like a "mail service" that allows the user to package their programs through images; this makes it
easier to run a program in the form of a container outside the user's local machine.

## Images
Docker images are comparable to a virtual machine environment. Docker images are templates that contain instructions on how to create a Docker container. 

## Containers
Docker containers are the runnable instances (applications or services) of Docker images. The Docker container runs based on the instructions in the Docker image.
